          "explain": "There are tons of ways to use technology! Apps can entertain us, help us communicate with our friends and family, and teach us new things.",
          "parentTip": "Showing interest in your child's online activities builds trust and understanding. If your child likes playing video games, play with them. If your child likes watching TikTok videos, learn a TikTok dance together."

          "explain": "Passwords on our accounts and devices make it so nobody can access our personal information except us. Don't share your password with anyone other than your parent/caregiver and try to use a different password for each account. That way, if one password is revealed, your other accounts stay safe.",
          "parentTip": "To make your password as strong as possible, use a phrase rather than one word, and mix in cAPiTal letters, symbols (%&$#) and numbers. You can even use numbers in the place of letters."

          "explain": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT can be fun and helpful! But it's important to think about when it is and isn't okay to use them. Using an AI tool to write an assignment or answer questions on a test is plagiarism and can have serious consequences. If you're not sure how you're allowed to use AI tools in school, ask your teacher first.",
          "parentTip": "Generative AI technologies like ChatGPT work by reading existing text (like content on the internet) and using that information to answer our questions. But just like you shouldn't trust everything you read on the internet, you also shouldn't trust everything an AI tool tells you!"

          "explain": "Safe apps and websites usually have reviews, privacy policies, and don't ask for too much of your personal information. If a website or app feels sketchy, ask a trusted adult before using it. If something feels off, it probably is!",
          "parentTip": "Let's make a list of red flags that might indicate an app or website is a scam. Examples include: - It has weird typos. - The site says you have a security issue. - The site promotes prizes or coupons."

          "explain": "Sharing personal details like your full name, address, school, or phone number could put your safety at risk. Avoid sharing information or photos that could give someone clues about where you live or how they could contact you directly."

          "explain": "Lots of people screenshot messages from their friends. This isn't always bad, but it can cause problems. You might think you sent something privately, but there's always a chance that it could be shared with other people, even if you sent it through an app that doesn't save messages.",
          "parentTip": "If you want to talk about something private, it's better to do it in person. It's not your fault if someone shares something that you sent them privately, but you can reduce the risk of this happening by thinking before you hit send."

          "explain": "It's normal to present a different version of yourself online. People often choose to post only the \"best\" parts of their lives, which can make it seem like what happens online isn't \"real life.\" But that's not true! You can be held accountable for the things you say and do online and they can have real impacts on your real life.",

          "explain": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is very cool, but it isn't perfect! Sometimes, AI tools like ChatGPT give incorrect information. If an AI tool tells you something and you want to figure out whether it's true, ask a trusted adult. This is also a good reason why you should never use AI to complete school assignments. Not only is that plagarism, but AI might also give you incorrect information!",
          "parentTip": "ChatGPT is an example of generative AI, a technology that works by analyzing huge quantities of text and using the patterns and structure in that data to generate new text. It's important to remember that while AI answers may seem human, they're not! These tools attempt to mimic human speech, but they can mess up and give us incorrect information."

          "explain": "Social media platforms, video games, and other apps and websites can be fun to use, but they come with risks. The content on these platforms isn't appropriate for younger children. Age restrictions also protect kids from the harms that some users experience online - like cyberbullying.",
          "parentTip": "It's important to be honest about your age when signing up for an app. Age restrictions are there for a reason. If you're too young to sign up, you're too young to use the app!"

          "explain": "The internet is full of scammers looking to steal your personal information. Often, scam emails or texts will tell you there's a problem you need to solve. A scam email, called a \"phishing attempt,\" might say that you need to update the password to one of your accounts. Other times, a scam email might say that you've won a prize in a contest you don't remember entering.",
          "parentTip": "Look closely at texts and emails asking for your personal information and read the names of websites and email addresses closely - if there's a typo or something else suspicious, it's probably a scam!"

          "explain": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are trained on huge amounts of online data. They identify patterns in that information, which they use to predict the right answers to your questions or generate images in response to your prompts. It's important to remember that while these tools can mimic human language, they don't think or learn like we do.",
          "parentTip": "Because generative AI tools have been trained using data from the internet, they can produce content that is inappropriate or incorrect. AI tools also learn from the information we feed them - remember never to give tools like ChatGPT personal information."

Other companies might use your data to recommend you content that you might like, in order to keep you on their platform for longer and longer amounts of time.",
          "parentTip": "Have you ever thought about why apps like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok are free? One reason is that these companies make money off of your personal data. When you use these apps, they learn about you. That's valuable information to advertisers, who want to sell you products!"

          "id": 12,
          "question": "Have you ever checked your privacy settings on your favorite apps?",
          "explain": "Privacy settings often control who can see your posts, send you messages, and find your profile. Often, apps come with \"default\" privacy settings. If you want to set your profile to private or block people that you aren't friends with from sending you messages, you may need to change your settings.",
          "parentTip": "Let's look at some of your privacy settings together and see if we can figure out what they all mean. Sometimes, it can be difficult to figure out exactly how to change your privacy settings!"

          "explain": "Some people use fake names for privacy, but others use them to hide their bad online behavior. Don't automatically assume that everyone online is who they say they are - fake names and pictures make it easy for users to pretend to be people they're not online.",
          "parentTip": "What are some of the pros and cons of anonymous accounts online? While creating an anonymous account protects your personal information, these types of accounts also make it easy for people to lie about who they really are. Tricky people might create anonymous profiles to try to convince you that they're someone they're not!"

          "explain": "Your digital footprint is everything you post, like, and share online. Remember, everything that you do online could be there forever - even if you think you deleted it! Think carefully about posting mean comments or liking inappropriate content - that will become part of your digital footprint and could be found by others in the future.",

          "explain": "Emojis, gifs, and slang make communicating online fun! But sometimes, what we say online can be taken out of context. It's important to remember that we can't hear someone's tone of voice in a message or comment, so they can be easily misinterpreted!"

Let's set up your accounts so that strangers can't message you. Remember, if someone you don't know does message you, do not to share any personal information.",

          "explain": "Lots of games that are popular with kids (including Minecraft, Roblox, and Fortnite) let you message other users. While messaging can be fun, there's always a chance that someone might send you a scary or inappropriate message. Just like it's not appropriate for adults to talk to kids they don't know in person, it's also not okay for adults to talk to kids they don't know online. Setting up your accounts to prevent strangers from messaging you helps keep you safe.",
          "parentTip": "We can set up your accounts so that other users can't message you. If anyone ever does say something inappropriate to you online, tell a trusted adult right away. No one will ever be mad at you about something bad that happened to you!"

          "parentTip": "There are so many ways to hide your real identity online. Tricky people might use someone else's photo as their profile picture or even use a voice modification app to sound younger or older than they really are. What other ways might someone conceal their real identity?"

          "explain": "When accepting friend or follow requests, it's best to stick to people you know in real life or can verify through a trusted source. That way, you don't accidentally accept a request from someone who's lying about who they really are.",

If you ever feel like you need to mute or block someone, please tell me or another trusted adult. I want to keep you safe and it's easier for me to do that when I know what's going on in your life!",
          "parentTip": "Never feel bad for muting or blocking someone who's bothering you. You should always put your own safety and wellbeing first. If someone tells you they will be upset or sad if you block them, that's emotional manipulation and you should tell a trusted adult."

If kids from school are involved, you can talk to a teacher or guidance counselor for help. If you feel comfortable, you can also messsage the bully privately and ask them to stop. You can always ask me for help as well. I can help you figure out what to do.",

That way, you can cool off and think rationally about it. You can even consider exiting the chat - it's brave, not dramatic, to walk away from toxic digital spaces.",

If someone is threatening to release intimate texts or nude photos, that's called sextortion. Don't give in! Tell me or another trusted adult immediately. I'd rather keep you safe than have you hide things because you think I'll be mad.",
          "parentTip": "You may think that you need to do what the person asks to get them to stop, but if someone pressures you for one thing, they'll ask for more. They're not going to be satisfied, even if you give them what they want. Telling a safe adult can prevent the situation from getting worse."

If a teacher, coach, or other adult contacts you privately online, you should tell me. Adults know that this behavior is inappropriate - any adult that breaks this rule may be trying to get you to engage in other unsafe behaviors.",

It's not normal for adults to want to communicate with you about personal topics.

Age restrictions also help ensure that users have the emotional maturity needed to handle the harms they may encounter on these platforms. Because social media companies collect data on users, age restrictions also ensure that young kids' personal information is not collected and sold by these companies.",

          "explain": "\"Doomscrolling\" refers to binging negative news or social media content - like content about a natural disaster, political situation, or other crisis. It's natural to want to stay up-to-date with current events, and social media can intensify this urge by presenting us with a never-ending stream of content. The best thing we can do to prevent doomscrolling is be mindful about our social media habits. Try to notice when and why you tend to doomscroll and set mindful goals to conquer the scroll!",
          "parentTip": "One great way to cultivate mindfulness is to set app limits! Have you ever looked at how much time you spend on different apps? Do you think you're spending more time than you'd like on social media? If so, consider using a third-party app to set time limits on these apps."

When posting on social media, try to consider how you might feel about the post in 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, and 1 year. If you think you'll regret it, don't post! You can also go back and delete any old content you no longer want on your social media platforms. Just remember that just because you deleted it doesn't mean it's gone for good - it's very difficult to permanently remove content online."

          "explain": "Most people associate addiction with substances like alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, but behaviors like gambling or social media use can also be addictive! A love of social media becomes an addiction when all thoughts are centered around it, to the point where other aspects of life are negatively impacted. For example, if you find that social media use is harming your ability to sleep, attend classes, or participate in social activities, it could be an addiction. If you start to feel this way, let me know so I can help you set healthy boundaries.",
          "parentTip": "Anyone can struggle with social media use, overuse and addition, but teens are particularly vulnerable. That's because of the specific ways in which research shows that teens' brains are wired! In kids and teens, the parts of the brain that are involved in resisting temptation are not fully developed. And, in adolescence, brains are especially attuned to social connections. What do you think that means for how social media impacts teens?"
